# Prescription Prompt FrontEnd Project

This project is a frontend app designed ultimately as a reminder but with many more features. The app is mainly targeted to the elderly and the forgetful as well as the carers for the concerned parties. With this app, it takes the effort of remembering the medications you need to take off your mind and keeps it stored in your phone.

The app has an easy to use and user friendly experience in order to set up prescriptions and medications that need to be taken at specific times throughtout the day. Once a Prescription is made, a handly calendar appears on your apps homepage showing a countdown to your next medication as well as times and information regarding future medication intakes.

The app is linked with a reliable backend server that keeps track of users created, prescriptions that are added and even a list of medications relevant to each specific user. A link to the Github Project Group containing the frontend repository and backend repository as well as the organisation leaders can be found here:
